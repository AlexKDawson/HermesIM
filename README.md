# Welcome to my new website!


##Why am I remaking my website?


My first website was an attempt to learn ruby on rails however I personally found two issues with it.


1. I tried learning by using scaffolds which took away much of the educational value and left me with way more files and sub-folders than I knew what to do with.


2. I kept gravitating to javascript whenever I wanted to add some functionality and even ended up using it once or twice.


So I'm rebuilding the website in node for a cleaner structure and a more hands on environment where I can use JS. All the while giving the site a much needed update to make it look more appealing.
